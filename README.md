# blog-app-server
Rest Api for a blog app built in Node with express and mongodb. I wanted to do it as complete as possible so it has authentication, psw encryptation and Json Web Token Validation.

It has routes and controllers for the following actions:

-Auth---login,register,

-Get all users in the database, get single user, update user and delete user

-create a post, get a single post, update a post and delete a post
